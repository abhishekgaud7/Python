# write a program to print the first n even natural numbers using a for loop
# The program should ask the user to enter the value of n.
# Then, it should print the first n even natural numbers.
# For example, if the user enters 5, the program should print 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
# The program should also calculate and print the sum of these even natural numbers.
# Finally, the program should display the average of these even natural numbers.

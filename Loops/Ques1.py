# 1. If-Else Conditional Statements
# Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero.
# Create a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18).
# Write a program that takes a number from the user and prints "Even" if it is even, otherwise "Odd".

# 2. Match Case Statements
# Ask the user to enter a day number (1–7) and print the corresponding day of the week using match case.
# Write a program using match case that simulates a simple calculator.
# Ask the user for two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /).
# Perform the operation using match case.

# 3. For Loops
# Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
# Print the multiplication table of a number (entered by user).
# Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop.
# Print the following pattern using a for loop:
# *
# **
# ***
# ****



# 4. While Loops
# Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
# Write a program that keeps asking the user to enter a password until they enter the correct one.
# Use a while loop to reverse a given number (e.g., 123 → 321).


# 5. Break, Continue, and Pass Statements
# Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10, but stop the loop if the number is 7 (use break).
# Print numbers from 1 to 10, skipping the number 5 (use continue).
# Write a loop that goes through numbers 1 to 5, but does nothing for number 3 (use pass).
